I am a fourth year Ph.D student in the Department of [Computer Science](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu) at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu) and I am working as a Research Assistant at [Wolfpack Security and Privacy Research Lab](https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu). I am advised by [Dr. William Enck](https://www.enck.org). My research interests broadly fall within the areas of systems security and privacy, currently with a focus on analyzing and improving the security of mobile payment systems and protocols. I apply program analysis and reverse engineering techniques to discover vulnerabilities in Android applications. My recent publications include performing static analysis to find non-compliance of payment apps with industry standards(PCI DSS), finding contradictory privacy policy of Android applications and identifying flow to policy level inconsistencies of apps from Google Play Store. These works have been recently published at USENIX Security. 

In Summer 2021, I interned at PayPal with the Threat management team supervised by [Dr. Adam Oest](https://www.adamoest.com) and [Dr. RC Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rc-johnson-7234aa74/). In this internship I explored different ways PayPal's in house mobile payment SDKs (i.e Braintree, PayPal) could be misued in both Android and iOS ecosystem and tried to measure the impact in terms of both financial loss and security implications. 

Previously, I worked at [KONA](https://konai.com), where I developed mobile payment solutions for both android and iOS platforms and before that, I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/). 

I am open for collaborating in my research domain so fell free to message if you are interested.
